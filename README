A Hadoop Job schedule that assign each job in round robin manner sort by certain weight.

The job weight is calculated as following:

(start_time*mpas*mpas*reduces*reduces)/(finished_maps * finished_maps * finished_reduces *finished_reduces)
  *(now -start_time)

aim to 
1.old jobs should finished first
2.less task jobs should finished first.
3.job that nearly finished should finished first.

When assiging tasks to tasktrackers,the scheduler will always considered local map task first,try for every submited jobs.
This should result in all tasks are local task.
